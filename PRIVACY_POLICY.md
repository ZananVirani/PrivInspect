# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Feb 21, 2026

## Overview

Privacy Inspector is a browser extension designed to analyze the privacy characteristics of the webpage you are currently visiting. This extension does not collect, store, or sell personal user data. All analysis is performed solely to generate a privacy score for the active webpage.

## Information We Collect

Privacy Inspector accesses **non-identifying webpage metadata** only, including:

- Domain names referenced by scripts and cookies on the current webpage
- Cookie names (not cookie values)
- Script metadata (such as source domain and whether scripts are inline)

The extension **does not collect**:

- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Browsing history
- IP addresses
- Account credentials
- Cookie values
- Form input or user-generated content

## How Information Is Used

The collected webpage metadata is used exclusively to:

- Identify domains associated with known invasive or tracking behaviors
- Evaluate how frequently these domains appear on a webpage
- Generate an overall privacy score for the page being viewed

This analysis helps users understand how privacy-invasive a webpage may be.

## Data Storage and Retention

- No personal data is stored.
- Webpage metadata is processed transiently and is not retained after analysis.
- The extension may store a short-lived access token locally using browser storage solely for authenticating requests to its backend service. This token does not contain user-identifying information.

## Backend Processing

If backend services are used to compute privacy scores, only **non-personal webpage metadata** required for scoring is transmitted. No data is shared with advertisers, analytics platforms, or third parties.

## Third-Party Data Sources

Privacy Inspector may rely on publicly available datasets that classify domain-level tracking behavior. These datasets contain no user data and are used only to assess the privacy characteristics of webpage domains.

## User Control

Privacy Inspector operates only when you actively browse the web. Users may disable or uninstall the extension at any time through their browser settings.

## Remote Code

Privacy Inspector does not execute remote code. All executable logic is packaged with the extension and backend services. Remote configuration is not used to alter extension behavior.
